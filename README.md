# go-caskdb

Go-CaskDB is a disk-based, embedded, persistent, key-value store based on the [Riak's bitcask paper](https://riak.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf) , written in Golang inspired from [py-CaskDB](https://github.com/avinassh/py-caskdb). It is more focused on the educational capabilities than using it in production. The file format is platform, machine, and programming language independent.
